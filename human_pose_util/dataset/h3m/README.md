Provides data for the human 3.6 million dataset (h3m).

# Conversion to hdf5
The pose data is provided in .cdf format. The `dataset` in this folder is based on the data being converted to a .hdf5 file first. The conversion requires pycdf and the associated cdf binaries to be installed/accessible. See [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37232008/how-read-common-data-formatcdf-in-python) for pointers on installation.
